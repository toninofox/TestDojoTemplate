## Phase 1
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
- But for multiples of *three* print “*Fizz*” instead of the number 
- For the multiples of *five* print “*Buzz*”. 
- For numbers which are multiples of *both* three and five print “*FizzBuz**”.

## Phase 2
- A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 **or** if it has a 3 in it
- A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5 **or** if it has a 5 in it
